Eagle board files for a small RFD22301 shield

This board allows an RFD22301 unit to address a dual-channel N-MOSFET IC on pins 0 and 1.

BOM:

(1) MOSFET IC http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/FDS6911/FDS6911CT-ND/1197695

(1) 3V3 regulator https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11253

(1) RFD22301 http://www.semiconductorstore.com/cart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=48872

(1) 10uF 0805 cap https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11244 (not strictly necessary, but wise)

...the board is laid out to use SMD JST connectors (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8612) for battery and two loads, but you can also solder your own connectiors
