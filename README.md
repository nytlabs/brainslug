This board allows an RFD22301 unit to address a dual-channel N-MOSFET IC on pins 0 and 1.

This is the MOSFET IC: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/FDS6911/FDS6911CT-ND/1197695

BOM:
(1) MOSFET IC http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/FDS6911/FDS6911CT-ND/1197695
(1) 3V3 regulator https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11253
(1) RFD22301 http://www.semiconductorstore.com/cart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=48872

...the board is laid out to use SMD JST connectors (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8612) for battery and two loads, but you can also solder your own connectiors
